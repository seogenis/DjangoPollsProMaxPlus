models.ObjectLog is a database object that is intended to track and update/edit 

1. Implement serializer.LoggedModelSerializer such that
    a) Any new objects created with a LoggedModelSerializer are tracked with an ObjectLog entry
        example:
        ObjectLog - id: 1
            timestamp: 2024-05-29T18:07:40.136519+00:00
            model_name: "Choice"
            object_id: 1
            field_name: None
            action: "CR"
            previous_value: None
            new_value: None

    b) Any objects that are modified with the LoggedModelSerializer are tracked with an ObjectLog entry
        example:
        ObjectLog - id: 2
            timestamp: 2024-05-29T18:07:40.136519+00:00
            model_name: "Choice"
            object_id: 1
            field_name: "choice_text"
            action: "M"
            previous_value: "a"
            new_value: "b"

2. Implement models._log_model_deletion such that
    a) ALL objects (except for ObjectLog objects themselves) are tracked by an ObjectLog entry
        example:
        ObjectLog - id: 3
            timestamp: 2024-05-29T18:07:40.136519+00:00
            model_name: "Choice"
            object_id: 1
            field_name: None
            action: "D"
            previous_value: None
            new_value: None
